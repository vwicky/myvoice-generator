# TTS model that generates my voice

I have never done that but that's why it's still more exciting to begin.
First, we'll need to obtain our training data. My native tongue is Ukrainian so the data'll be in Ukrainian as well.
I thought that rather than transcribing text I'll choose some book and then record me reading it aloud. I've settled upon Kundera's "Unbearable Lightness of Being". I prepared the first chapter.

Alright, I made the recording. First, I wanna check how well will the model function without some big data preparations and then if needed I'll clean the audio files.

I tried downloading MFA and Aeneas. Aeneas kinda works but does not support Ukrainian; MFA does support but it doesn't work. What does it mean for me? What path will I choose? Just kidding. I'll try creating an English model and if everything goes gine I'll work on Ukrainian one.
It also occured to me that If I'll have my recording of the same text in Ukrainian and English and could make a translation model? Who knows.
